1. The most challenging part of the assignment was ensuring it works well on mobile as well. I think it was challenging to work in HTML and CSS as I'm not super familiar with it. This assignment took 20 hours.
2. To make my site mobile friendly, I chose to use percentages for the navbar and tables in some of the pages. I also used media tags to modify the size of the sudoku puzzles for different screen sizes. The logo in the navbar had it's size fixed in the corner, but the logo in the homepage scales with the size of the screen.
3. For the design of the website, I really wanted the page to be easy on the eyes, so I chose a light blue for the navbar. I really liked the darker shade used in the currently selected page on the navbar as well, as the current page was still legible even with the darker color. Finally, I was able to find a color for the font that matched pretty well to the generated logo from design.com. I also really was proud of the hover over navbar links that cause them to highlight with the same color.
4. Given more time and resources, I would create more popups that display useful information. I think having a help button with the image standard of a question mark on the page with the puzzles would be nice. I would have the help button open the rules in the same page, rather than having to navigate to the rules page for the rules.
5. I spent about 20 hours, 10 hours spread throughout different the two weeks.
